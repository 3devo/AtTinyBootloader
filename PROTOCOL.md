3devo attiny bootloader protocol
================================
This protocol allows communicating with the bootloader running on an
attiny or other small microcontroller, through I²C. Its main purpose is
to allow writing an application to flash and executing that application.

This document describes protocol version 1.0 (0x0100).

Transactions
------------
All transactions take the form of a write transfer (command plus
arguments), followed by a read transfer (status plus command result).

A write transfer consists of: A command byte, any number of argument
bytes and two CRC bytes.

A read transfer consists of: A status byte, any number of result bytes,
and one CRC byte.

Visually, this looks like the following. A white background indicates
the line is controlled by the master, a gray background indicates the
line is controlled by the slave.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Start</td><td>address+W</td>
<td>command</td>
<td>argument bytes...</td>
<td>CRC</td>
<td>Stop (optional)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start</td><td>address+R</td>
<td style="background-color: #aaa">status</td>
<td style="background-color: #aaa">number of result bytes</td>
<td style="background-color: #aaa">result bytes ...</td>
<td style="background-color: #aaa">CRC</td>
<td>Stop</td>
</tr>
</table>

Acks and nacks are omitted from this table, but are present after each
byte. All bytes should be acked by the other party than the one that
sent the data. A nack should always mean the end of the transfer, but
the last byte in a transfer does not need to be acked (though it
typically is in a read transfer).

The maximum read or write length is 32 bytes (excluding address, including
everything else).

The number of result bytes in the transfer indicates the number of
result bytes, excluding the status, the number itself and the CRC.

The master should either look at the length byte to know how much bytes
to read, or it should make sure to read enough bytes so all possibly
expected replies would fit. If the master is unable to look at the
length byte during the transfer and thus reads more bytes than the slave
has available, the slave should just return arbitrary values. The master
should ignore these by looking at the length byte after the transfer.
Alternatively, it could do a short read first, look at the length byte
and then do a longer read to get the full reply.

The CRC is calculated over all bytes, except the address byte.

Status codes
------------
The status byte can have these values:

| Value       | Meaning                           | Result bytes
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------
| 0x00        | `COMMAND_OK`                      | Command-specific
| 0x01        | `COMMAND_FAILED`                  | Command-specific
| 0x02        | `COMMAND_NOT_SUPPORTED`           | None
| 0x03        | `INVALID_TRANSFER`                | None
| 0x04        | `INVALID_CRC`                     | None
| 0x05        | `INVALID_ARGUMENTS`               | None
| 0xff        | Unused                            |

When multiple reads happen in succession, each should return the same
data. This allows the master to re-try a read when it detects a CRC
error in the reply, without having to re-issue the command again.

Multi-byte values
-----------------
Any multi-byte values specified in this protocol should be transmitted
in network order (big endian), so with the most significant byte first.

Clock stretching
----------------
The slave is allowed to apply clock stretching at any time during a
transaction in order to process the command given or for other reasons.
This includes the entire write *and* read, to allow for example the
slave to execute the command either directly after receiving it, after
seeing a stop condition or only during the read just before sending its
reply.

The total clock stretching that may be applied by the slave during an
entire transaction is 35ms. Having a maximum stretch time allows the
master to detect a timeout and abort the transaction. The master is also
allowed to stretch the clock, no bounds are imposed on that. The slave
should not attempt to detect a timeout itself, but instead rely on the
master. The slave should instead monitor the bus for a start condition,
to always allow the master to start a new read or write.

I2C addresses
-------------
Instead of responding to a single address, the slave will respond to a
range of different addresses. Even though this increases the chance of
one of these addresses colliding with other devices in the system, there
is only a small chance that *all* of these addresses collide. The
protocol includes a `SET_I2C_ADDRESS` command that makes the slave
respond to just a single address, after which all other addresses can be
used as normal without conflicts.

The bootloader will initially respond to any I2c address in the 8-15
range.

CRC
---
The protocol uses CRC-8-CCITT, which should provide protection against all
1-bit and 3-bit errors, and good protection for 2-bit errors up to the maximum
message size. See the [publication by Philip Koopman][koopman] for CRC
comparisons. This CRC was mostly chosen because an efficient AVR implementation
is available and it seems to perform well enough.

Polynomial: x^8 + x^2 + x + 1 (0x83 / 0xE0)
Starting value: 0xff
No output XOR

Version compatibility
---------------------
The slave is assumed to have a small and fixed bootloader, which implements a
single version of this protocol. The master is assumed to be more complex and
easily upgraded, and will typically support all versions up to the current
version.

This means that a newer master with an older slave should always work, since
the master has explicit support for older protocol versions. When an older
master (e.g. older firmware on the master) is running against a newer slave,
things should just work if possible, but at least allow an error message to
be shown.

This protocol is initially designed to talk to a microcontroller on the
interface board. This microcontroller needs to take action to enable the
display before an error message can be shown to the user, so this protocol
contains some special provisions for this case (e.g. the `POWER_UP_DISPLAY`
command).

Additionally, the following rules apply:
 - All future version of this protocol, should implement at least the
   `GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `SET_I2C_ADDRESS` and, if appropriate, the
   `POWER_UP_DISPLAY` commands, as specified in the 1.0 version of this
   protocol. All other commands can be changed in any way (including
   different framing, checksums, etc.), provided the protocol version is
   bumped appropriately.
 - Whenever a change is made that would cause a master implementing an
   older version of the protocol to stop working (commands no longer
   working or not having the intended effect), the major protocol
   version should be increased.
 - For all other changes, such as adding new commands or arguments, the
   minor protocol version is increased.

For the master, this means that it can always send the three commands
mentioned above, and any other commands must be sent after establishing
the protocol version in use (provided the master knows about it). If the
master knows about the major protocol version, but the minor protocol
version is higher that what it supports, the master can just assume the
minor version is the highest one it supports.

When processing replies, the master should be tolerant of unexpected
values and extra bits (ignore them if possible). If this behaviour
would break things (e.g. a new reply value that requires the master to
act differently), the major version should be bumped, otherwise only the
minor version would suffice. Note that adding extra bytes to a reply
always requires bumping the major version, since the master dictates how
much bytes are read.

Applications
------------
The bootloader is intended to allow uploading an application into flash
and to start it. The intention is that on *every* startup, the master
uploads an application (with the slave taking care to prevent an
erase-write cycle if the same application is uploaded twice). For this
reason, the bootloader has no timeout value and does not start the
application unless explicitely instructed.

This means that the application that is run (after being uploaded by the
master) is strongly tied to the master application. This removes all
need for protocol compatibility between application versions, or between
the bootloader and the application. The only thing the application
*must* support is the general call reset command (see the generall call
section elsewhere in this document).

However, it is encouraged for the application to use the same framing
format (write/read pairs, checksum, timeout constraints, command and
status codes, etc.). Any commands that make sense (e.g.
`SET_I2C_ADDRESS`) can also be implemented, new commands should be
defined in the range reserved for application commands.

General call handling
---------------------
The bootloader and the application should support the general call
address (0x00+W), and in particular the reset (0x06) and reset address
(0x04) commands.

A general call consists of a write to the 0x00 I2c address, followed by
a command byte. No additional framing (e.g. no CRC) happens, and no
reply is read in response to the command.

The reset address command (0x04) should revert the effect of the
`SET_I2C_ADDRESS` command and make the bootloader respond to the default
I²C addresses again. If the application also implements
`SET_I2C_ADDRESS` or something similar, it is recommended to also
implement the reset address command.

The reset command (0x06) should do the same, but also do a hardware
reset of the slave (which should start the bootloader again).

The master should always send a general call reset command at startup,
which serves to get all slaves into a known state, running the
bootloader. This prevents issues when the master resets, while the slave
does not, resulting in the slave running application code while the
master needs to talk to the bootloader.

Commands
========
The base protocol defines these commands:

| Value       | Meaning
|-------------|---------
| 0x00        | `GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION`
| 0x01        | `SET_I2C_ADDRESS`
| 0x02        | `POWER_UP_DISPLAY`
| 0x03        | `GET_HARDWARE_INFO`
| 0x04        | `START_APPLICATION`
| 0x05        | `WRITE_FLASH`
| 0x06        | `FINALIZE_FLASH`
| 0x07        | `READ_FLASH`
| 0x80 - 0xfe | Reserved for application commands
| 0xff        | Reserved

TODO: read flash? Eeprom? Signature bytes?

`GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION` command
------------------------------
This command returns the protocol version implemented by the slave split into a
major and minor part. For example, version 1.0 would be 0x01, 0x00, while
version 10.2 would be 0x0a, 0x02.

See the section on compatibility on how the master is expected to handle
this version number.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `GET_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (0x00)
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | Major version
| 1     | Minor version
| 1     | CRC

`SET_I2C_ADDRESS` command
-------------------------
This command allows changing the I2c address, to prevent conflicts with
other I²C devices.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `SET_I2C_ADDRESS` (0x01)
| 1     | I2c address to use
| 1     | Hardware type
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | CRC

The I²C address given is the 7-bit address, where the MSB is ignored by
the slave and must be set to 0 by the master.

The device type is a selector to select only devices of a particular
type. This can be used when multiple devices share the same bus and
respond to the same address, so they can still be disambiguated based on
their device type.

When a slave receives this command containing a hardware type that does
not equal its own type (as returned by `GET_HARDWARE_INFO`), it should
completely ignore the command (and not respond to the subsequent read
request either).

A device type of 0x00 is a wildcard, all devices should process that.
Masters should only use this when they are certain that at most one
device will be respond, since there is no provision to handle conflicts.

The actual switch can happen either before or after the response is
read. The master should read a response from the old address, and if no
reply is received, it should read from the new address.

`POWER_UP_DISPLAY` command
--------------------------
This command is intended specifically for the interface board, and
serves as a fallback in case the master cannot normally upload a
firmware and power up the display using that (because the bootloader
protocol is too new, or uploading repeatedly fails, etc.). When this
command is given, the bootloader executes the proper sequence for
powering up the on-board display. No initialization commands are sent to
the display, this should be done by the master.

Clock stretching should be used to ensure the transaction does not
complete before the display is powered on and ready.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `POWER_UP_DISPLAY` (0x02)
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00) or `COMMAND_NOT_SUPPORTED` (0x02)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | Controller type
| 1     | CRC

Modules that do not have an on-board display should just return
`COMMAND_NOT_SUPPORTED`.

The result includes single controller type byte, which indicates the
type of display controller attached. Currently only one type is defined:
0x01 to indicate an SSD1306 or compatible controller.

This command is intended as a last-resort option, since the
powerup-sequence is hardcoded and might not be ideal.


`GET_HARDWARE_INFO` command
---------------------------
This command requests information about the hardware the bootloader runs
on.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `GET_HARDWARE_INFO` (0x03)
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | Hardware type
| 1     | Hardware revision
| 1     | Bootloader version
| 2     | Available flash size
| 1     | Max message size
| 1     | CRC

The following hardware types & revisions are defined:

| Type | Revision | Meaning
|------|----------|---------------------
| 0x00 | -        | Reserved for wildcard in `GET_I2C_ADDRESS` command
| 0x01 | 0x01     | Interface board v1.3

The bootloader version value is informative (and should be considered
board-specific) and its value is not defind by this specification.

The available flash size indicates the number of bytes of flash that are
available to write to.

The max message size indicates the largest I²C message that can be sent
or received (including the checksum, excluding the address byte).

`START_APPLICATION` comand
--------------------------
This command tells the bootloader to start the application. To simplify
slave implementation, this command returns no reply, so the application
can be started immediately after receiving the command, instead of
having to wait for a reply to be read first.

TODO: Perhaps do send a reply and complicate the slave code a bit?

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `START_APPLICATION` (0x04)
| 1     | CRC

`WRITE_FLASH` command
---------------------
This command allows writing an application to flash.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `WRITE_FLASH` (0x05)
| 2     | Address
| 0+    | Data
| 1     | CRC

The address specified indicates the (byte) address of the first byte to
write.

To simplify the slave implementation, this command should only be used
to write consecutive bytes to flash, starting at address 0. In
particular the address must either be one past the last byte written, or
it must be zero to start, or start over. If this constraint is violated,
the slave should return `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` and otherwise ignore the
packet (so the next write should be accepted if it is consecutive with
the previous valid write). This allows the master to retry a write when
it receives in invalid checksum on a reply. It should then ignore the
`INVALID_ARGUMENTS` error on the retry.

Writing to flash in this way guarantees that the sent bytes are
(eventually) written, but the rest of the flash contents becomes
undefined (e.g. parts of it will likely be erased).

Due to flash page sizes, the data sent might not be written immediately,
but is typically buffered until a full flash page can be written (and is
then automatically written). At the end of flashing, the
`FINALIZE_FLASH` command must be given to commit any remaining bytes to
flash.

When the bytes sent are identical to the current content of the flash,
the slave should prevent an erase-write cycle. This allows the master
to send write commands on every startup, without danger of wearing out
the flash contents.

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `INVALID_ARGUMENTS` (0x05)
| 1     | Length

|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_FAILED` (0x01)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | Reason
| 1     | CRC

When flashing fails for any reason, an additional reason byte is
returned. The meaning of this byte is purely informative and not defined
by this protocol, it should be looked up in the bootloader.

`FINALIZE_FLASH` command
------------------------
This command commits all unwritten bytes (as sent by `WRITE_FLASH`) the
the flash memory. After this command, no further `WRITE_FLASH` commands
should be sent, except with a zero address to start over.

| Bytes | Command field
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Cmd: `FINALIZE_FLASH` (0x06)
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_OK` (0x00)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | CRC

| Bytes | Reply format
|-------|-------------------------------
| 1     | Status: `COMMAND_FAILED` (0x01)
| 1     | Length
| 1     | Reason
| 1     | CRC

When flashing fails for any reason, an additional reason byte is
returned. The meaning of this byte is purely informative and not defined
by this protocol, it should be looked up in the bootloader.

`READ_FLASH` command
------------------------
This command reads the specified number of bytes from the specified
address and returns them. This reads the current state of flash, so when
this is given between `WRITE_FLASH` and `FINALIZE_FLASH`, it might
return an inconsistent state.

| Bytes | Command field
